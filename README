== Twitter Geolocation Demo

This application demonstrates streaming twitter statuses into a mongodb capped collection in order
to view the top 50 tweets nearest a particular latitude/longitude coordinate.

In order to start streaming the data, use:

rake twitter:stream CREDENTIALS=twitter_username,twitter_password

You must have set up your twitter account per the streaming API documents.

To run tests, just run: rspec spec. It is not necessary to rake test:db:prepare.

To use, enter Latitude and Longitude coordinates and click search. You can click on both map markers and
screen name links to open a window showing the corresponding tweet on the map.
